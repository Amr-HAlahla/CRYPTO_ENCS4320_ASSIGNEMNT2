## TEA Encryption and Decryption

This Python code implements the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA), a lightweight symmetric block cipher designed for simplicity and efficiency. TEA operates on 64-bit blocks of data with a 128-bit key, providing a fast and secure encryption method. 

### Methodology
TEA works by iteratively applying a set of operations including bitwise XOR, addition, and shifting, in multiple rounds (typically 32) to encrypt and decrypt data. This process ensures a high level of security while maintaining efficiency.

### Functionality
The code offers versatile functions for encrypting and decrypting both text and BMP image files. It supports two modes of operation: Electronic Codebook (ECB) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), enhancing flexibility and usability.

## Usage
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Import necessary functions or execute code directly.
3. Follow prompts to input key and choose encryption mode.
4. View encrypted and decrypted data as per chosen mode.
